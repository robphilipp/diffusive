Diffusive is a truly distributed, distributed-computing framework based on diffusion. Diffusive is a Java-based framework that provides the capability to distribute the execution of any Java method simply by marking it with @Diffusive. That method is distributed to a network of computing resources. The resources responsible for executing or further distributing that method are called diffusers. Similar to Actor-based frameworks, a diffuser can either execute the method, or pass it on to other diffusers.

The beauty of Diffusive is that you don't have to change your code to use it. Importantly, you define the way your code executes, and let Diffusive manage how the execution is distributed across the network of diffusers.
