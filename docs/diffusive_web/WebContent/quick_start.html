<p>The <b>Diffusive</b> reference implementation works, but is still in development. There are still a number of
items and features to be implemented for the base version. And there are a number of enhancements that ought to
be developed regarding deployment and management of the diffusive network. So if you find you like Diffusive, please
participate (contact: <a href="mailto:rob.philipp@gmail.com?Subject=Contributing%20to%20Diffusive">Rob Philipp</a>).</p>

<p>For a more complete description of diffusive programming and the reference implementation, please see the
<a href="overview_guide.html">the Overview</a> or download the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/diffusive/files/diffusive_programming.pdf">Diffusive Programming</a> paper.</p>

<!-- 

	Getting Started

 -->
<h2 id="getting_started"><a href="#participate">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>The next sections describe how to work with Diffusive in its current state. As Diffusive evolves, many of the
idiosyncrasies of the current state will be removed, and it will become much easier to work with and use. For now,
however, as I heard someone say: &quot;<em>it is what it is, and if it were different, it'd be different</em>&quot;.</p> 

<!--
    Running the Examples
-->
<h3 id="running_examples"><a href="#participate">Running the Examples</a></h3>
<p>New to Diffusive version 0.2.0 are a set of examples that you can run with minimal configuration. There are three
examples:</p>
<dl>
    <!-- local, stand-alone -->
    <dt>Local, Stand-Alone Diffusion</dt>
    <dd>
        This is the first, and simplest example, and should run without any modification. In this example, you launch
        the example application by using the <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>, and the methods marked
        <b class="class">@Diffusive</b> in the <b class="class">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Task</b> will be diffused
        to a local diffuser, by the application-attached diffuser.
    </dd>

    <!-- local -->
    <dt>Local Diffusion</dt>
    <dd>
        This second example builds on the first. Although, in this example, everything runs on a local machine, you will
        actually diffuse code to a diffuser running in a separate process. By configuring your application-attached
        diffuser differently, and launching a <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b>, the diffusive method in the
        <b class="class">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Task</b> will be diffused to the RESTful diffuser server.
    </dd>

    <!-- remote, single -->
    <dt>Single, Remote Diffusion</dt>
    <dd>
        This third example builds on the first two by adding a <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b> running on a
        different machine. The diffusive method in the  <b class="class">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Task</b> will now
        be diffused to the remote RESTful diffuser server. Additionally, the local RESTful diffuser server will provide
        the remote RESTful diffuser server the <b class="class">Class</b> object it needs to deserialize and execute
        the diffused method.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>The <b class="tt">examples</b> subdirectory of the distribution directory contains the configuration files for these
three examples, a <b class="tt">README.txt</b> file for each example, and the JAR file containing the example code that
is to be run using Diffusive. In the next sections we give steps to run the examples.</p>

<!-- Local, Stand-Alone Diffusion -->
<h4 id="local_stand_alone_diffusion"><a href="#participate">Local, Stand-Alone Diffusion Example</a></h4>
<p>Recall that in this example we will launch the example application by using the <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>,
    and the methods marked <b class="class">@Diffusive</b> in the <b class="class">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Task</b>
    will be diffused to a local diffuser, by the application-attached diffuser.</p>

<p>The configuration files for the local, stand-alone diffusion example can be found in the
    <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/examples/local_stand_alone</b> directory. This directory contains a subdirectory <b class="tt">launcher</b>
    and a <b class="tt">README.txt</b>. The subdirectory has two files: <b class="tt">restful_diffuser_config.xml</b> and
    <b class="class">random_diffuser_strategy.xml</b>. The first file is the configuration file used by the
    <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b> to set the strategy, the object serializer, and end-points used by the
application-attached diffuser. In this example, we don't need to alter either of these configuration files.</p>

<p>To run this example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Change to the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/jars</b> directory</li>
    <li>Type <b class="tt">java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar --config-dir=../examples/local_stand_alone/launcher/
                                                                  --execute-class=org.microtitan.tests.threaded.MultiThreadedCalc
                                                                  --class-path=../examples/example_0.2.0.jar</b></li>
</ol>

<p>The end of your output should look something like this. <img src="images/local_stand_alone_results.png"> Make sure that
out of the 20 tasks run, all completed.</p>

<p>Now let's turn to the command-line options in step 2.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>--config-dir</dt>
    <dd>This option tells the diffusive launcher where to find the configuration files. In this case, we have specified
        that <b>relative</b> to the <b class="tt">jars</b> directory, the configuration files are up one directory and in the
        <b class="tt">examples/local_stand_alone/launcher</b> directory.
    </dd>

    <dt>--execute-class</dt>
    <dd>This option tells the diffusive launcher in which class the application's <b class="class">main(...)</b> method
        can be found. The "application" is the application you wish to execute through Diffusive. In this case, we are
        executing the multi-thread calc test application <b class="class">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.MultiThreadedCalc</b>.
    </dd>

    <dt>--class-path</dt>
    <dd>This option tells the diffusive launcher where to find the classes that are part of the application to be executed,
        and which are not part of the diffusive distribution.<br><br>
        It is important to point out that you <b>must</b> use this option, and not the standard option <b class="tt">-cp</b>
        (or <b class="tt">-classpath</b>), and not the class path environment variable when specifying where to find
        the application classes.<br><br>
        Recall that when running a Java application, which is packaged in a JAR, using the command<br>
        <b class="tt">java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar</b><br>
        the class path used by Java to load classes is the one
        specified in the JAR file's manifest (the Class-Path attribute). If you ran the command<br>
        <b class="tt">java -cp directory/to/nowhere -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar</b><br>
        Java will ignore the class path
        you specified on the command-line. In fact, it will ignore <b>all</b> other class path settings. (See, for example,
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html">Oracle's Java launcher documentation</a>.
        Specifically, see the documentation for the "-jar" option: "When you use this option, the JAR
        file is the source of all user classes, and other user class path settings are ignored.")
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>For a full list of the diffuser launcher's command-line options, type<br>
<b class="tt">java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar --help</b></p>

<!-- Local Diffusion -->
<h4 id="local_diffusion"><a href="#participate">Local Diffusion Example</a></h4>
<p>Recall that in this example, although all processes will run on our local machine, we will diffuse methods to a RESTful
    diffuser server running in a separate process than the process from which we launched our application. Accordingly,
    this example will be slightly more complex and require us to make a few modifications to the diffusive launcher's
    configuration files. And, we'll have to start up a RESTful diffuser server first, before we launch the example
    application.</p>

<p>The configuration files for the local diffusion example can be found in the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/examples/local</b>
    directory. This directory contains two subdirectories <b class="tt">launcher</b> and <b class="tt">diffuser_server</b>,
    and a <b class="tt">README.txt</b>.</p>

<p>The <b class="tt">launcher</b> directory contains the same configuration files as in the local, stand-alone example.
    However, we want diffusive launcher to diffuse methods to the RESTful diffuser server running in a
    separate process. To achieve this, we'll have to modify its strategy configuration file,
    <b class="class">random_diffuser_strategy.xml</b>,by specifying the end-point (IP address) for the RESTful
    diffuser server.</p>

<p>The <b class="tt">diffuser_server</b> subdirectory contains the configuration files for the RESTful diffuser server.
    Because the RESTful diffuser server will run on the local machine, and won't diffuse
    methods any further, we won't have to modify any of its configuration files for this example.</p>

<p>To run this example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Change to the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/jars</b> directory</li>
    <li>From the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/jars</b> directory, type<br>
        <b class="tt">java -jar Diffusive_Server_0.2.0.jar --config-dir=../examples/local/diffuser_server/
                                                           --class-path=../examples/example_0.2.0.jar</b><br>
        to start the RESTful diffuser server.
    </li>
    <li>Replace the text, "<b class="tt">your.ip.address</b>", with your IP address (or domain name), in the
        configuration file <b class="class">launcher/random_diffuser_strategy.xml</b>. Do not use
        "<b class="tt">localhost</b>" as your IP address.
        <pre class="brush: xml; highlight: 4">
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
            <RandomDiffuserStrategyConfigXml>
                <clientEndpoints>
                    <endPoint>http://your.ip.address:8182/diffusers</endPoint>
                </clientEndpoints>
                <randomSeed>3141592653</randomSeed>
            </RandomDiffuserStrategyConfigXml>
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>From the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/jars</b> directory, type<br>
        <b class="tt">java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar --config-dir=../examples/local/launcher/
                                                             --execute-class=org.microtitan.tests.threaded.MultiThreadedCalc
                                                             --class-path=../examples/example_0.2.0.jar</b><br>
        to launch the example application.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The end of your output should look something like this. <img src="images/local_results.png"> Make sure that
    out of the 20 tasks run, all completed. And best of all, notice that how much slower your application ran! Using
    the local diffuser, the runtime was about 4.3 seconds. Now using the RESTful diffuser, we're at 7.8 seconds! We're
    well on our way to maximizing our execution time! Well,
    that's the overhead of serializing/deserializing the methods' objects and the results. You'll also have noticed that
    the terminal window from which you started the RESTful diffuser server spit out some logs.</p>

<p>You're on a roll. Now for the more complicated example!</p>

<!-- Single, Remote Diffusion -->
<h4 id="single_remote_diffusion"><a href="#participate">Single, Remote Diffusion Example</a></h4>
<p>Recall that in this example we'll be diffusing a method from our local machine to a remote machine. This example is the
    most complex of the three examples. There are a fair number of things that can go wrong that may prevent the example
    from working properly. So we'll try to give you the tools to get basic troubleshooting information that will help
    you separate your configuration or system/network problems from any bad code in Diffusive.</p>

<p>The configuration files for this example are located in the <b class="tt">Diffusive_vX.Y.Z/examples/remote_single</b>
    directory. This directory contains three subdirectories <b class="tt">launcher</b>, <b class="tt">diffuser_server</b>,
    and <b class="tt">remote_diffuser_server</b>. It contains one <b class="tt">README.txt</b> file.</p>

<p>The local RESTful diffuser server in this example is slightly different from its purpose in the previous, local diffusion,
    example. In the local diffusion example, the application-attached diffuser diffused methods to it. In this example,
    the application-attached diffuser diffuses methods to the remote RESTful diffuser server, and the local RESTful
    diffuser server provides the <b class="class">Class</b> objects to the remote diffuser server.</p>

<p>To run this example:</p>
<dl>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notice that we don't add the class path to the example code when we start the remote diffuser server. Recall that
        the local RESTful diffuser server will provide the <b class="class">Class</b> objects.</p>

<p>The end of your output should look something like this. <img src="images/remote_single_results.png"> Make sure that

<p>If everything ran correctly, then congratulations! You ran this, and are well on your way to become a proficient diffuser!
If, on the other hand, you had problems, then there are a couple quick things you can try.</p>

<h5 id="single_remote_diffusion_troubleshooting"><a href="#participate">Troubleshooting</a></h5>
<dl>
    <dt>Connectivity Issues</dt>
    <dd><p>If Diffusive just hangs an then times out (and spews error message on one of your three terminal windows) you
        could have connection issues. For example, you may have a firewall running on one of your machines that doesn't
        allow port 8182, or external connections, or neither. You can test this. Recall that the diffusers are RESTful
        web services. So, we attempt to can connect to them through our browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lets try to connect to the RESTful diffuser server on the remote machine. Open a browser, and type<br>
                <b class="tt">http://ip.address.of.remote.machine:8182/diffusers</b><br>
                And you should get back something like this<br>
                <img src="images/remote_server_diffuser_list.png"><br>
                This ensures that you can connect to your remote diffuser server.
            </li>
            <li>Now we want to make sure that you can get from your remote diffuser server to you local diffuser server.
                This is important because the remote diffuser server needs to get the <b class="class">Class</b> objects from
                the local diffuser so that it can deserialize the objects coming to it from your application-attached diffuser.
                So we do the same thing, except from you remote machine, open a browser and type<br>
                <b class="tt">http://ip.address.of.local.machine:8182/diffusers</b><br>
                and you should see a similar item.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>Class Path Issues</dt>
    <dd><p>Recall that the remote diffuser server relies on the class path end-point specified in the laucher's configuration
        file. In our case, the remote diffuser server calls the local diffuser server to ask for the <b class="class">Class</b>
        objects. If the local diffuser server can't locate the class requested by the remote diffuser server, then we
        have a problem.</p>

        <p>You can test this in a similar manner as we tested for connectivity. From a browser on your local machine, type<br>
            <b class="tt">http://ip.address.of.local.machine:8182/classpath/org.microtitan.tests.threaded.MultiThreadedCalc</b><br>
            and you should get back something like this<br>
            <img src="images/multi_calc_class_bytes.png"><br>
            Repeat this for the following classes:
            <ol>
                <li><b class="tt">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Task</b></li>
                <li><b class="tt">org.microtitan.tests.threaded.Result</b></li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>If you did NOT have connectivity problems, then repeat the above tests from the remote server.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Recheck you configuration files</dt>
    <dd><p>Maybe you miss-typed an IP address or switched your local and remote IP addresses.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If neither of these turn out to be the issue, then set the log-level to <b class="tt">DEBUG</b> through the command-line
    option, <b class="tt">--log-level=DEBUG</b> for the launcher and the two servers and retry. Maybe the logs will give
    you some nugget of information.</p>

<p>If still nothing works. Don't get frustrated. Rather, <a href="mailto:rob.philipp@gmail.com?subject=Diffusive Help">send me</a>

<!-- 
	Configuring Diffusive
 -->
<h3 id="configuring_diffusive"><a href="#participate">Configuring Diffusive</a></h3>
<p>Given its current-state idiosyncrasies, configuration of Diffusive is accomplished through Java source files that are
are compiled with the build. (See <a href="#configuration_idiosyncrasy">configuration idiosyncrasy</a>.) There are two 
parts of Diffusive the must be configured: the diffuser configuration; and, the diffuser-server configuration. In the
next two subsections we describe the purpose and elements of both configurations.</p>

<p>Recall that, although all diffusers are the same, the application-attached diffuser is the diffuser to which <em>diffusive</em>
methods are dispatched. It is the application-attached diffuser that then distributes the method call to remote diffusers. To do
this, the application-attached diffuser must know which to which remote diffusers it can send methods--in other words, it must
know its end-points and its diffusion strategy. It must also know which serialization mechanism to use. And, it must be able to
supply the remote diffuser with a set of class paths from which the remote diffuser can load classes. This configuration is
covered in the next section, <a href="#default_diffuser_configuration">Default Diffuser Configuration</a></p>

<p>Recall also that to communicate with a RESTful diffuser, you must launch a diffuser server (<b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b>). 
The diffuser server provides two services. It provides access to the diffusers. And, it provides access to the <b class="class">Class</b>
objects needed by the remote diffuser's class loader. The <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b> extends the
<b class="class">javax.ws.rs.core.Application</b> class and binds to the JAX-RS resources,
<b class="class">RestfulDiffuserManagerResource</b> for access to the diffusers, and the <b class="class">RestfulClassPathResource</b>
to allow remote loading of classes. When a new <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserManagerResource</b> is created, it must be handed
a default set of end-points and a strategy with which to select the end-points. We cover this configuration in the section,
<a href="#diffuser_server_configuration">Diffuser-Server Configuration</a></p> 

<!-- Default Diffuser Configuration -->
<h4 id="default_diffuser_configuration"><a href="#participate">Default Diffuser Configuration</a></h4>
  
<p>When using the <a href="javadocs/index.html?org/microtitan/diffusive/launcher/DiffusiveLauncher.html"><b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b></a>
directly, without extending and customizing it, the only configuration you must perform is related to the:
<ol>
	<li>Type of serialization you would like to use for the objects that are transferred over the network.</li>
	<li>Location of the remote diffusers with which you would like to interact.</li>
	<li>Class path URI that remote diffusers will look to when attempting to load a class.</li>
</ol>
<p>And all this configuration is held in the
<a href="javadocs/index.html?org/microtitan/diffusive/launcher/config/RestfulDiffuserConfig.html"><b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfig</b></a>
class' <b class="class">configure()</b> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@DiffusiveConfiguration
public static final void configure()
{
	// 1. create the serializer
	String serializerName = SerializerFactory.SerializerType.OBJECT.getName();
	SerializerFactory factory = SerializerFactory.getInstance();
	Serializer serializer = factory.createSerializer( serializerName );

	// 2. create the diffusion strategy. this holds the end-points (location) of the
	//    remote diffusers to which annotated methods are diffused, and the strategy
	//    used to determine the end-point for a diffused call.
	DiffuserStrategy strategy = createStrategy();
	
	// 3. create a list of end-points remote diffusers will look to when attempting
	//    to load a class
	List< URI > classPaths = createClassPathList();
	
	// IMPORTANT:
	// create the diffuser and add it to the global diffuser repository. this is
	// needed because the byte-code engineering framework needs access to the 
	// diffuser so it can replace the annotated method calls.
	Diffuser diffuser = new RestfulDiffuser( serializer, strategy, classPaths, LOAD_THRESHOLD );
	KeyedDiffuserRepository.getInstance().setDiffuser( diffuser );
}
</pre>

<p>You may have noticed a set of static variables a the top of the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfig</b> source file.</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
// holds the list of client endpoints to which diffused methods are sent. the end-point must
// have a restful diffusive server running that can accept requests.
public static final List< String > CLIENT_ENDPOINTS = Arrays.asList( "http://192.168.1.4:8182" );

// holds the base URI of the class path that gets passed to the remote diffuser manager 
// when creating a diffuser. this allows the remote code to load classes from a remote 
// server. This URI typically points to the host running that is launching the code to be 
// diffused (since it is that code that has the classes), or some other host that holds 
// all the required classes (that have been deployed there) and is running a restful 
// diffuser server
public static final List< String > CLASSPATH_URI = Arrays.asList( RestfulDiffuserServer.DEFAULT_SERVER_URI );

// the threshold for CPU loads, above which the diffuser will send the tasks to a 
// remote diffuser, unless of course, there are no client end-points specified. When 
// the threshold is below the load threshold, the diffuser will call the local diffuser 
// to execute the tasks.
public static final double LOAD_THRESHOLD = 0.5;
</pre>

<p>These variable provide an easy way to set the basic configuration. However, you can update this class to read
from a file, or do whatever you want. This configuration file can also be changed, and we discuss that and a few
other basic customizations in the next section.</p>

<!-- Custom Diffuser Configuration -->
<h4 id="custom_diffuser_configuration"><a href="#participate">Custom Diffuser Configuration</a></h4>
<p>In most cases the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfig</b> class should provide enough flexibility. However,
more than likely you'll want to implement a configuration class that reads the configuration from a file (for
sure I have that on my ToDo list). Although you could simply modify the existing <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfig</b>
class, a more sensible approach is to create a new class that meets your needs, and then tell the 
<b class="class">DiffusiveLoader</b> object to use that configuration class.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is quite straightforward. Simply create a new class <b class="class">MyDiffusiveLauncher</b> that
extends <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>. In your new launcher, create a main and use the following code.</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class MyDiffusiveLauncher extends DiffusiveLauncher {

	public static void main( String[] args )
	{
		// create a loader with that uses your specific configuration class and use
		// that to create a diffuser launcher
		List< String > configClasses = Arrays.asList( MyConfigClass.class.getName() );
		DiffusiveLoader loader = createLoader( configClasses );
		DiffusiveLauncher launcher = new DiffusiveLauncher( loader );

		final String classNameToRun = // the name of the your application's main class
		final String[] programArgs = // the program arguments expected by your application
		launcher.run( classNameToRun, programArgs );
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Notice that we no longer use <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>'s default, no-arg constructor. Instead,
we use the <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher.createLoader(...)</b> method to create a new loader that uses
your new configuration class instead, and then hand that new loader to the <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>'s
constructor. The new configuration class is shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class MyConfigClass {

	@DiffusiveConfiguration
	public static final void configure()
	{
		// add your configuration code
		.
		.
		.
		
		// IMPORTANT: you MUST create the diffuser and add it to the repository
		// create the diffuser and add it to the global diffuser register
		Diffuser diffuser = new RestfulDiffuser( serializer, strategy, classPaths, LOAD_THRESHOLD );
		KeyedDiffuserRepository.getInstance().setDiffuser( diffuser );
	}
}
</pre>

<p>More extensive customizations, such as creating and using a new loader follow the same pattern. Clearly, the
<b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b> could be updated to allow that specification of the configuration class.
That would be a great contribution.</p>

<!-- Diffuser-Server Configuration -->
<h4 id="diffuser_server_configuration"><a href="#participate">Diffuser-Server Configuration</a></h4>

<p>When running the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b> class' <b class="class">main(...)</b> method without any
command-line arguments, it uses the default configuration class, <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServerConfig</b>. In a
manner similar to the configuration of the application-attached diffuser, the server configuration method(s) are identified
by the annotation <b class="class">@DiffusiveServerConfiguration</b>. The code below shows the default configuration 
method.</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
@DiffusiveServerConfiguration
public static final void configure()
{
	// 1. create a list of end-points that all new diffusers will have
	List< URI > clientEndpoints = // the list of end-points
	
	// 2. create the strategy by which end-ponts are selected
	DiffuserStrategy strategy = new RandomDiffuserStrategy( clientEndpoints );
	
	// 3. IMPORTANT: all configurations MUST add the strategy to the repository
	// 	  add the strategy to the diffusive-strategy repository
	KeyedDiffusiveStrategyRepository.getInstance().setValues( strategy, LOAD_THRESHOLD );
}
</pre>

<p>The customization of the the diffusive-server configuration can be accomplished by creating a new configuration
class and specifying it in as a command-line argument when launching the server.</p>

<!-- 
	Running Diffusive
 -->
<h3 id="running_diffusive"><a href="#participate">Running Diffusive</a></h3>

<p>Running Diffusive is pretty straightforward. In this section we'll walk you through running the test cases using
Eclipse IDE. In this way, you'll be set up for debugging and participating in Diffusive's development.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fire up Eclipse on all the machines that will participate and note their IP addresses.</li>
	<li>In the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfig</b> class, update the end-points to hold all
		the IP addresses <b>except</b> the box on which you will launch the application.</li>
	<li>In this example, we won't be doing any nested diffusion, so make sure that the end-points
		defined in the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServerConfig</b> is an empty list. This tells
		new diffusers that they will run everything locally, and won't diffuse any methods further.</li>
	<li>Perform the second step on all the machines.</li>
	<li>Run <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b> on all the machines without specifying any
		command-line arguments.</li>
	<li>Run <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b> on your local box without specifying any command-line
		arguments.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, the code should be diffusing and your results will soon start coming back. You can adjust the logging levels
on the remote machines if you would like to see some action.</p>
