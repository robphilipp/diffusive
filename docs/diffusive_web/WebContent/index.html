    <h3 id="goals"><a href="#goals">The Goal</a></h3>
    <p>The goal of <b>Diffusive Programming</b> is to make method-level, task-oriented distributed computing easier by
        separating the execution logic from the distribution logic.</p>

    <h3 id="what_it_is"><a href="#goals">Easier Distributed Computing</a></h3>
    <p><b>Diffusive</b> is a Java reference implementation of the <a href="overview_guide.html#the_principles">six
        principles</a> that define <em>diffusive programming</em>. <b>Diffusive programming</b> attempts to overcomes
        several inconveniences found in traditional distributed computing approaches:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Any Method Can Be Diffused (Distributed)</dt>
        <dd>There are no <b class="class">Task</b> (or similar) interfaces to implement. <b>Any</b> method, with
            <b>any</b> signature can be diffused (distributed).
        </dd>

        <dt>To Diffuse (Distribute) a Method, Simply Mark the Method</dt>
        <dd>Methods are marked for diffusion (distribution) using the <b class="class">@Diffusive</b> annotation.
            That's all. It's that simple!</dd>

        <dt>Don't Worry about Pre-Deploying Class Files</dt>
        <dd>You don't need to pre-deploy the <b class="class">class</b> files to any of the compute nodes.
            <b>Diffusive</b> will load the <b class="class">Class</b>es it needs at runtime from the requesting
            diffuser, or from a location you configure.
        </dd>

        <dt>Enjoy an Open Topology</dt>
        <dd>The topology of the network of nodes can be anything that can be represented as a directed graph. Topologies
            can be tailored to solve specific problems.
        </dd>

        <dt>Diffusers Can Diffuse (Easy Map-Reduce)</dt>
        <dd>Because all <b>Diffusers</b> are equal, there is no difference between diffusers accepting an execution task
            and a diffusers requesting an execution task. This allows a distributed method to further distribute
            methods. In other words, you can do <a href="overview_guide.html#multi_layered">nested diffusion</a>, and
            therefore, easily implement map-reduce.
        </dd>

        <dt>The Diffuser Network is Dynamic</dt>
        <dd>Method execution is distributed to a network of nodes that can be configured or added and removed
            dynamically.
        </dd>

        <dt>RESTful API</dt>
        <dd>Communication between nodes uses a RESTful API.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="more_info"><a href="#goals">More Information</a></h3>
    <p>For a more complete description of diffusive programming and the reference implementation, please see the
        <a href="overview_guide.html">the Overview</a> or download the
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/diffusive/files/diffusive_programming.pdf">Diffusive Programming</a>
        paper.</p>

    <h3 id="whats_new"><a href="#goals">What's New</a></h3>
    <h4>Version 0.2.0 (from version 0.1.3)</h4>
    <p>This is first version that allows users to run Diffusive from the distribution JAR files, and to separate the
        application (to diffuse) from the distribution JARs. Previous version required Diffusive to be run from an IDE.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Developed command-line interfaces for <b class="class">DiffuserLauncher</b>, and for the
            <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServer</b>. These new interfaces allow you the ability to set various options
            and configuration items. To get more details, execute the jars from the command-line with the <b class="tt">--help</b>
            option: <br><b class="class">java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar --help</b></li> or
            <br><b class="class">java -jar Diffusive_Server_0.2.0.jar --help</b>
        <li>Developed command-line interfaces for the XML configuration objects: <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserConfigXml</b>
            and the <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserServerConfigXml</b> that can generate and validated configuration files.</li>
        <li>Added three examples with increasing complexity:
            <ol>
                <li>A stand-alone local diffuser that allows you to run diffusive without starting a diffuser server.</li>
                <li>A local diffuser example that runs a local RESTful diffuser server and the diffuser launcher on
                    the same machine.</li>
                <li>A single remote example that runs a local RESTful diffuser server to provide class resources, a remote
                    RESTful diffuser server to perform the execution, and a local diffuser launcher.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug related to the loading of class files that were neither in the JAR, or in the JAR's manifest's
            <b class="tt">Class-Path</b> (which wasn't so easy). This is needed so that JAR files containing the user's
            application can be run and loaded for <b class="class">RestfulClassLoader</b> and
            <b class="class">RestfulDiffuserClassLoader</b>.</li>
        <li>Improved some JAX-RS exception mapping. Not yet at the point I'd like it to be.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Version 0.1.3 (from version 0.1.2)</h4>
    <p>Updated the configuration files so that it can be run locally right out of the box (based on suggestion
        from Anteneh Nurlien).</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Updated the configuration files so that <b class="class">restful_server_config.xml</b> and
            <b class="class">random_diffuser_strategy.xml</b> don't have any end-points. This allows
            diffusive test cases to be run locally without any configuration. Just run the
            <b class="class">RestfulDiffusiveServer</b> class, and then the <b class="class">DiffusiveLauncher</b>
            class, and it should run.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug that prevented diffusive from running when no end-points were specified in the
            configuration files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Version 0.1.2 (from version 0.1.0)</h4>
    <p>Main change is the new capability to configure diffusers from XML files. Also small updates to
    incorporate fixes and added features from <a href="http://freezedried.sourceforge.net">FreezeDry</a>.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Modified Diffusive's server and diffuser configuration classes to load an XML file containing
            the basic configuration properties. As part of this, add XML files for configuring the diffuser
            strategy. This allows the diffuser strategy to be specified in diffuser configuration XML file.
            Now the diffuser server can be configured from <b class="class">restful_server_config.xml</b>,
            the diffusers can be configured from <b class="class">restful_diffuser_config.xml</b>, and the
            diffuser strategies can be configured from <b class="class">random_diffuser_strategy.xml</b>
            and <b class="class">random_weighted_diffuser_strategy.xml</b></li>
        <li>Updated FreezeDry from version 0.2.2 to version 0.2.4 (see
            <a href="http://freezedried.sourceforge.net/overview_guide.html#whats_new">FreezeDry updates</a>
            for more details).</li>
    </ol>
