            <p><b>Diffusive</b> is a truly <em>distributed</em>, distributed-computing framework based on diffusion.
                Diffusive is a Java-based framework that provides the capability to distribute the execution of any
                Java method simply by marking it with <code>@Diffusive</code>. That method is distributed to a network
                of computing resources. The resources responsible for executing or further distributing that method
                are called <em>diffusers</em>. Similar to Actor-based frameworks, a <em>diffuser</em> can either
                execute the method, or pass it on to other <em>diffusers</em>.</p>

            <p>The beauty of Diffusive is that you don't have to change your code to use it.
                Importantly, you define the way your code executes, and let Diffusive manage how the execution is distributed
                across the network of diffusers.</p>

            <h3 id="highlights"><a href="#goals" class="scroll-offset">Working with Diffusive</a></h3>
            <div id="accordion" class="my-accordion">
                <h3>any method can be distributed</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>You don't need to implement the equivalent of a <code>Task</code> interfaces.
                        <b>Any</b> method, with <b>any</b> signature, anywhere in your code can be distributed.
                        Some examples are listed below:</p>
                    <pre class="brush:java">
                        public double calc( long seed, long maxIterations ) { ... }
                        public void doOp( ParamSet params, int options ) { ... }
                        public Result minimize( List< Param > params, int[] options ) { ... }
                        public Result< Double > calc() { ... }
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <h3>simply mark the methods you want distributed</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Methods are marked for distribution using the <code>@Diffusive</code> annotation.
                        It's that simple! Marking a method means that when it is called, its execution will be distributed
                        to a remote location.</p>
                    <pre class="brush:java">
                        @Diffusive public double calc( long seed, long maxIterations ) { ... }
                        @Diffusive public void doOp( ParamSet params, int options ) { ... }
                        @Diffusive public Result minimize( List< Param > params, int[] options ) { ... }
                        @Diffusive public Result< Double > calc() { ... }
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <h3>build a network of diffusers</h3>
                <div>
                    <p><em>Diffusers</em> are responsible for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>executing a request</li>
                        <li>distributing that request to another <em>diffuser</em>, or</li>
                        <li>creating a new <em>diffuser</em> to which to distribute that request</li>
                    </ul>
                    This means that you can build a network of diffusers simply by giving each diffuser a set of end-points
                    to which it can forward requests.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/star_network.png"></p>
                    <p>The topology of the diffuser network can be anything that can be represented as a directed graph.
                        Which means that you can design topologies tailored to solve your specific problems.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>no need to pre-deploy class files</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>A dynamic and generic distributed computing environment provides the ability to send any
                        work to any physical or virtual compute node at any time. For the distribution of work to be truly
                        dynamic means you may not know which nodes will be part of your computation before you start.</p>
                    <p><em>Diffusive</em> understands that and manages the loading of <code>java.lang.Class</code>
                        objects for you. That means you don't have to worry about pre-deploying your class or JAR files.
                        And you can configure where <em>diffusers</em> go to get their class objects.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>nested diffusion</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>All <em>diffusers</em> behave the same way--there is no difference between diffusers that
                        accept work and those that distribute work. This means that if a method marked <code>@Diffusive</code>
                        calls another method marked <code>@Diffusive</code> then the first method will be distributed
                        to a remote diffuser, and the second method will be further distributed by that same remote diffuser.</p>
                    <pre class="brush:java">
                        @Diffusive
                        public double calcMeanValues( Map< String, List< Double > > values ) {
                            for( Map.Entry< String, List< Double > > entry : values.entrySet() ) {
                                meanValues.put( entry.getKey(), calcMean( entry.getValue() ) );
                            }
                        }

                        @Diffusive
                        public double calcMean( Collection< Double > values ) { ... }
                    </pre>
                    <p>In this example, a call to marked <code>calcMeanValues(...)</code> will be distributed to a
                        remote diffuser. Because the <code>calcMean(...)</code> method is also marked, when the method
                        executing on the remote diffuser a calls it, it will get further distributed to another
                        remote diffuser.</p>

                    <p class="image"><img src="images/nested_diffusion_example.png"></p>

                    <p><span class="label label-info">Definition</span>
                        <b>Nested diffusion</b> occurs when a <em>marked</em> method calls another <em>marked</em> method.
                    </p>


                    <div class="alert">
                        <strong>Note</strong> that you can easily implement a simple map-reduce through nested diffusion.
                    </div>

                </div>

                <h3>recursive diffusion</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>With nested diffusion a marked method calls another marked method. What happens when a marked method
                        calls itself?</p>
                <pre class="brush:java">
                    @Diffusive
                    public double recursiveMethod( double value ) {
                        value = // updated value
                        if( value > MAX_VALUE ) {
                            return value;
                        }
                        return recursiveMethod( value );
                    }
                </pre>
                    <p>In this example, the first call to <code>recursiveMethod(...)</code> will cause the execution
                        of that method to be distributed to a remote node. On that remote node, the call to itself,
                        which is a marked method, will cause the execution of that call to be distributed. And so it
                        will continue until the control logic puts a stop to it. If appropriately threaded, this could
                        allow the walking of networks with a simple recursive algorithm.</p>

                    <p class="image"><img src="images/recursive_diffusion_example.png"></p>

                </div>

                <h3>diffuser networks are dynamic</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Nodes that can be configured, added, and removed dynamically.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>uses a REST API</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Communication between nodes uses a REST API. This means that writing management and monitoring
                        tools becomes much easier. In fact, we are currently constructing a web application to manage
                        and monitor the diffusers and servers.</p>

                    <p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing"><em>distributed computing</em></a> we want to
                        balance the amount of work evenly across all available computing resources. In nature,
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"><em>diffusion</em></a> equalizes the concentration of
                        particles throughout the available volume

                        For example, suppose you gently place a drop of blue ink into a glass of still, clear water.
                        The ink slowly diffuses through the water until the concentration of ink is about equal throughout the
                        glass. </p>

                    <p><em>Diffusive</em> allows computational tasks to <em>diffuse</em> naturally throughout the
                        network of available computing resources.
                        This provides an organic load-balancing approach that doesn't require specialized
                        resources to manage the distribution of the work. And because of this, development and deployment using
                        <em>diffusive</em> is easier.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="what-is-it">
                    <p class="key-point">Diffusive programming doesn't require you to change your code.</p>
                    <p>Writing code that runs reliably on one machine and across many machines is difficult. Most distributed computing
                        frameworks require you to modify your code to use their framework. For example, in many task-oriented systems
                        all computational tasks must be wrapped into the equivalent of a <code>Task</code> interface that defines
                        some sort of an <code>execute(...)</code> method. Space-based approaches often require your code to
                        write the task into a <em>space</em> and then poll a <em>space</em> for the result. In
                        <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1008/1008.1459.pdf">Actor</a> based distributed computing, extensive
                        use of the actor-based API is often necessary.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="honors-execution">
                    <p class="key-point">Diffusive programming honors your execution logic.</p>
                    <p><em>Diffusive</em> programming assumes that the execution logic you defined in your code is the way you'd like your
                        code to execute. If your code is sequential for a stretch, because order matters, and then becomes concurrent,
                        <em>diffusive</em> honors that order. Your code defines the order in which it executes, and the <em>diffusive
                            framework</em> takes care of distributing the work.</p>
                    <p class="key-point">Diffusive allows you to separate your execution logic from your distribution logic.</p>
                    <p>This separation of the execution logic from the distribution logic is quite powerful. Recall how simple it was
                        to write algorithms for nested or recursive diffusion. And how that, for example, provides a natural way to
                        write a distributed map-reduce algorithm.</p>

                    <p class="key-point">Diffusive programming allows you to debug most of your code locally.</p>
                    <p>Suppose that your could run the same code completely locally or in a distributed manner <em>without</em> changing
                        your code. Now you could debug your application locally to ensure it runs correctly. Once you have your
                        application the way you want it, you can run the same code in a distributed manner. If there are bugs, they'll
                        be related to the distribute execution.</p>

                <h4 id="v0_2_0"><a href="#goals">Version 0.2.0</a></h4>
                <div>
                    <p>This is first version that allows users to run Diffusive from the distribution JAR files, and to separate the
                        application (to diffuse) from the distribution JARs. Previous version required Diffusive to be run from an IDE.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Developed command-line interfaces for <code>DiffuserLauncher</code>, and for the
                            <code>RestfulDiffuserServer</code>. These new interfaces allow you the ability to set various options
                            and configuration items. To get more details, execute the jars from the command-line with the <b class="tt">--help</b>
                            option: <br><code>java -jar Diffusive_Launcher_0.2.0.jar --help</code></li> or
                        <br><code>java -jar Diffusive_Server_0.2.0.jar --help</code>
                        <li>Developed command-line interfaces for the XML configuration objects: <code>RestfulDiffuserConfigXml</code>
                            and the <code>RestfulDiffuserServerConfigXml</code> that can generate and validated configuration files.</li>
                        <li>Added three examples with increasing complexity:
                            <ol>
                                <li>A stand-alone local diffuser that allows you to run diffusive without starting a diffuser server.</li>
                                <li>A local diffuser example that runs a local RESTful diffuser server and the diffuser launcher on
                                    the same machine.</li>
                                <li>A single remote example that runs a local RESTful diffuser server to provide class resources, a remote
                                    RESTful diffuser server to perform the execution, and a local diffuser launcher.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixed a bug related to the loading of class files that were neither in the JAR, or in the JAR's manifest's
                            <b class="tt">Class-Path</b> (which wasn't so easy). This is needed so that JAR files containing the user's
                            application can be run and loaded for <code>RestfulClassLoader</code> and
                            <code>RestfulDiffuserClassLoader</code>.</li>
                        <li>Improved some JAX-RS exception mapping. Not yet at the point I'd like it to be.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h4 id="v0_1_3"><a href="#goals">Version 0.1.3</a></h4>
                <div>
                    <p>Updated the configuration files so that it can be run locally right out of the box (based on suggestion
                        from Anteneh Nurlien).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Updated the configuration files so that <code>restful_server_config.xml</code> and
                            <code>random_diffuser_strategy.xml</code> don't have any end-points. This allows
                            diffusive test cases to be run locally without any configuration. Just run the
                            <code>RestfulDiffusiveServer</code> class, and then the <code>DiffusiveLauncher</code>
                            class, and it should run.</li>
                        <li>Fixed bug that prevented diffusive from running when no end-points were specified in the
                            configuration files.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h4 id="v0_1_2"><a href="#goals">Version 0.1.2</a></h4>
                <div>
                    <p>Main change is the new capability to configure diffusers from XML files. Also small updates to
                        incorporate fixes and added features from <a href="http://freezedried.sourceforge.net">FreezeDry</a>.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Modified Diffusive's server and diffuser configuration classes to load an XML file containing
                            the basic configuration properties. As part of this, add XML files for configuring the diffuser
                            strategy. This allows the diffuser strategy to be specified in diffuser configuration XML file.
                            Now the diffuser server can be configured from <code>restful_server_config.xml</code>,
                            the diffusers can be configured from <code>restful_diffuser_config.xml</code>, and the
                            diffuser strategies can be configured from <code>random_diffuser_strategy.xml</code>
                            and <code>random_weighted_diffuser_strategy.xml</code></li>
                        <li>Updated FreezeDry from version 0.2.2 to version 0.2.4 (see
                            <a href="http://freezedried.sourceforge.net/overview_guide.html#whats_new">FreezeDry updates</a>
                            for more details).</li>
